# Effect of the College Scorecard on Student Search Interest

## Overview
This project investigates whether the release of the College Scorecard by the U.S. Department of Education in 2015 influenced public interest in higher education institutionsâ€”particularly colleges with higher post-graduate earnings. We use Google Trends search interest as a proxy for attention or intent, and analyze how this changed before and after the Scorecard's release across different institutions.

## Research Question
"Did the College Scorecard increase online interest in colleges with higher graduate earnings compared to those with lower earnings?"

## Goals
* Estimate the causal impact of the Scorecard using Difference-in-Differences (DID) and related regression techniques.
* Visualize trends in search activity before and after the Scorecard by earnings group.
